Uncle Josh's Weather Report's 
=======================================================

This is a command line weather application using `click`_ originally from Seb
Vetter's `Writing Python Command-Line Tools With Click
<https://dbader.org/blog/python-commandline-tools-with-click>`_ and `Mastering
Click: Writing Advanced Python Command-Line Apps
<https://dbader.org/blog/mastering-click-advanced-python-command-line-apps>`_.
The tool pulls weather data from `Open Weather Map
<http://openweathermap.org>`_.  You will need an `api key`_ to make this tool
work.

The tool was then turned into a command using Amir Rachum's `Python Entry
Points Explained
<https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2017/07/28/python-entry-points/>`_ and expanded
with a cache mechanism to store data and only refresh it if it is over 10
minutes old.
