Tutorial - Building the extended tool
=====================================

After following the two tutorials from Seb Vetter, I created a setup.py file
using entry_points to give me access to the tool under ``weather`` instead
of ``cli.py``. This also meant I could use the tool from any command prompt.
This also introduced a `bug <https://github.com/JoshuaEnglish/weather/issues/1>`_.

Logging 
========

I tucked the following into the ``main`` function:

.. code::

    logging.basicConfig(filename='weather.log',
                        filemode='w',
                        format='%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(message)s',
                        datefmt='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p',
                        level=logging.INFO)

I also added the normal logging.info calls needed to provide output. I chose
to create a fresh log with every run, so the log only tracks the last time 
the tool was used.

With the logging done, I could move on to saving cities and the caching 
mechanism.

Saving Cities
=============

I decided to store the data with JSON. All I need is a simple dictionary 
of location, id pairs.  

To implement this I added:

.. code::
    
    DATA_PATH = os.path.abspath('.\data')

.. note:: Spoiler Alert

    This is a `bug <https://github.com/JoshuaEnglish/weather/issues/1>`_.

Then I wrote two functions, one to read the stored city data (or create
the empty file if needed) and one to save the file.

.. literalinclude:: ..\cli.py
   :pyobject: get_city_data

.. literalinclude:: ..\cli.py
   :pyobject: write_city_data
    

Caching Results
===============

First, I needed to decide how to store the data. JSON does a good job of this,
and I had two primary API URLs, and so I decided on:

    #. A data directory with the script ("solved" above)
    #. Saving responses in a <location>-<api>.json file
    #. Using the last time the file was modified by the system to determine 
       when to use the cache and when to get a fresh copy

The third point meant I didn't have to store any meta-data alongside the actual
data. 

.. note:: This could be simplified 

    It turns out the stored dictionary has a `dt` key with a number that can
    be transformed into a human readable date with 
    ``time.ctime(response.json()['dt'])`` so the file could be read and use
    this instead. 

    Using ``os.stat.st_mtime`` may be faster and won't require reading a file
    that we may have to write over anyway.


.. literalinclude:: ..\cli.py
   :pyobject: get_api_response
   
The three lines checking the 'cod' item take care of `this bug 
<https://github.com/JoshuaEnglish/weather/issues/2>`_.

Building the API query is bundled up into its own function and locks the
results into imperial units (default is Kelvin!) but it does handle getting
any stored city id for us.

.. literalinclude:: ..\cli.py
   :pyobject: build_query

Part of me wants to make the units configurable, and that opens up a few issues.
Do I keep a Fahrenheit *and* a Celcius copy of a response? That means more files
to store. I think an easier solution would be to leave the data in Kelvin and
convert to the preferred unit when collecting data or printing the output. 
The three scales are linearly related, so the exact point in of conversion 
shouldn't matter. Such tricks are an "exercise for the reader" at this point.
I would only bother if I decided I really needed to understand Celcius the same
way I understand Fahrenheit.
