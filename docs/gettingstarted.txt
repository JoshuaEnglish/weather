Getting Started
===============

As a learning experience, following the three tutorials referenced in the 
documentation and then reading :doc:`tutorial` will teach you what you need
to know.

Otherwise, install from GitHub using::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/JoshuaEnglish/weather.git
    $ cd weather
    $ python setup.py 

You will need an `api key`_ from OpenWeatherMap.org to make this tool work.
Once you have this key you can enter it into the program with::

    $ weather storeapi

The program will prompt you to paste your API Key and it will be stored for
future use.

Once you have pasted your API key into the system, you can get the current
weather report with::

    $ weather current Portland
    The weather in Portland right now: light rain

You can see what the program did under the hood::

    $ weather log
    03/26/2018 12:58:47 PM:INFO:Starting Weather CLI
    03/26/2018 12:58:47 PM:INFO:Getting current weather for Portland
    03/26/2018 12:58:47 PM:INFO:Getting response from host
    03/26/2018 12:58:49 PM:INFO:Caching response to C:\Windows\System32\data\Portland-current.json


How do you know you have the right city? You can examine the response::

    $ weather dump Portland
    {"coord": {"lon": -122.67, "lat": 45.52}, "weather": [{"id": 500, "main":
    "Rain", "description": "light rain", "icon": "10d"}], "base": "stations",
    "main": {"temp": 45.5, "pressure": 1028, "humidity": 75, "temp_min": 44.6,
    "temp_max": 46.4}, "visibility": 16093, "wind": {"speed": 6.93}, "clouds":
    {"all": 90}, "dt": 1522092900, "sys": {"type": 1, "id": 2963, "message":
    0.0054, "country": "US", "sunrise": 1522072828, "sunset": 1522117939}, "id":
    5746545, "name": "Portland", "cod": 200}

I happen to know that my Portland is at longitude -122 and change, and latitude
45 and and change, so I know this result is right. (Plus, the current weather is
"light rain" which is accurate for about seven months of the year.) However,
if I want to check several cities or maybe one of the other Portlands, I'm not
going to be sure unless I use the city id assignment. In this case, 5746545. 
(It's the "id" value in the response.)

I don't want to remember Portland is 5746545 and it would be better if the tool
did that for me::

    $ weather setcity Portland 5746545

Now the next call to the "Portland" location will substitute the exact city id.

Next, if we want the temperature::

    $ weather temp Portland
    Current temperature is 72.5 with a range of 69.01 to 75.90

If you examine the log::

    $ weather log
    03/26/2018 01:04:03 PM:INFO:Starting Weather CLI
    03/26/2018 01:04:03 PM:INFO:Getting temperature for Portland
    03/26/2018 01:04:03 PM:INFO:Returning cached copy of request

You can see the cached data was used instead of a fresh API call.
