Getting Started
===============

As a learning experience, following the three tutorials referenced in the 
documentation and then reading :doc:`tutorial` will teach you what you need
to know.

Otherwise, install from GitHub using::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/JoshuaEnglish/weather.git

You will need an `api key`_ from OpenWeatherMap.org to make this tool work.
Once you have this key you can enter it into the program with::

    $ weather config

The program will prompt you to paste your API Key and it will be stored for
future use.




.. _api key: http://openweathermap.org/appid
